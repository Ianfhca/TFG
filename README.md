# SNN Simulator using LIF neuron model

This project implements a **Spiking Neural Network (SNN) simulator** written in C++, with evaluation and visualization tools in Python. The goal is to offer a biologically inspired simulation for event-based classification tasks using spike data, based on the **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** model and **STDP** learning rules.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Fully implemented in C++ from scratch
- Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model
- Multiplicative **STDP** learning rule
- Input processing from the **IBM DVS128 Gesture Dataset**
- Flexible configuration using `.conf` files
- Support for convolutional and dense layers
- Automatic evaluation and visualization using Python (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
